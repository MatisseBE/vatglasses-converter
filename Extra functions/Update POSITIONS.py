""""
This file may be used to update your positions key when new sectors are added, or frequencies are changed.
It returns the position key with the previously issued colors, unless it is a new sector.


Create a new file in the Input folder called 'Positions_VG.json'. 
This file should be a json of the VG-key "Positions". I included an example of its contents. You should copy it from the VG repo (not beta)

A new file will be created './Output/positions_update.json'. Additionally, for your convenience, each position will be printed with its corresonding color,
as well as if a new color was assigned.
